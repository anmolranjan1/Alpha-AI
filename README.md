# Alpha-AI
A Voice Assistant Model using Python

## Introduction

Alpha A.I is a personal assistant program implemented in Python. It uses various libraries and modules to provide a range of functionalities, including voice recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web browsing, information retrieval, file handling, system actions, and more. With Alpha A.I, users can interact with their computer through voice commands and perform tasks easily.

### Install prerequisites
Install the required libraries and dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechrecognition
pip install wikipedia
pip install pywhatkit
pip install pyjokes
pip install PyPDF2
pip install psutil
```
### Usage
* Upon running the program, Alpha A.I will greet the user and ask for commands.
* Users can speak commands such as "Open YouTube," "Search Wikipedia," "Tell me a joke," "Play music," etc.
* Alpha A.I will respond to the commands and perform the requested actions.
* Users can interact with Alpha A.I until they choose to quit.

## Features
* Voice Recognition: Alpha A.I uses the speech_recognition library to listen for voice commands from the user.
* Text-to-Speech Conversion: The program utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech, allowing Alpha A.I to provide verbal responses to the user.
* Web Browsing: Users can instruct Alpha A.I to open popular websites like YouTube, Wikipedia, Google, Stack Overflow, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
* Information Retrieval: Alpha A.I can search for information on Wikipedia based on user queries and provide a summary of the results.
* Note Taking: The program enables users to dictate notes, which are then saved to a file. It also supports reading and displaying previously saved notes.
* Jokes: Alpha A.I can generate jokes from different categories and deliver them to the user.
* Music Playback: Users can ask Alpha A.I to open and play a specified music file.
* Time Announcement: The program can tell the current time to the user.
* Coin Toss: Alpha A.I can simulate flipping a coin and announce the result as heads or tails.
* Online Video Playback: Users can request Alpha A.I to search and play videos from YouTube.
* PDF Text-to-Speech: The program can read specific pages of a PDF file and convert the text to speech.
* Password Generation and Strengh Checker: Alpha A.I can generate strong passwords and can also check strength of passwords.
* Countdown Timer: Users can initiate countdowns for a specified number of seconds, and Alpha A.I will announce the remaining time.
* Quiz: The program can conduct a small quiz by asking questions and checking the user's answers.
* Temperature Conversion: Alpha A.I can convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
* Battery Percentage: The program can check the battery percentage of the system.
* System Actions: Alpha A.I can perform system actions such as shutdown, restart, hibernate, and log off.

The project provides a wide range of features and demonstrates the use of various Python libraries and modules for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web scraping, file handling, system interactions, and more.
